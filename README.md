# avrNetStack 

This aims to be a very modular Networking Stack running on AVR Microcontrollers and supporting different Network Hardware (ENC28J60, MRF24WB).
Select your MCU and hardware driver in the makefile.
Compile with "make lib" to create a static library.
Compile with "make test" to create a test file to use with the hardware found in Hardware.
